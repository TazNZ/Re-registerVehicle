# Re-register Vehicle in New Zealand

My experience with re-registering a damaged car in New Zealand.

I'm writing this document out to help others that might be on the fence about getting a damaged car back on the road if you so disire, I'm also writing my 
expereince and what I went through to successfully get my BMW 135i E82 back on the kiwi roads.

There is a little to nothing on AA, VTNZ and VINZ websites on how to actaully achieve this and they all point you back to NZTA.

The NZTA site is your best bet and a basic Google of "How to reregister a car nz" will result in the web page that has steps on how to go through the process, but
found that the info wasn't accurate and wasn't as simple as I thought.

# Re-register car that HASN'T been damaged or written off by insurance or law enforcement.

If you have a car that is deregistered but hasn't been involved in an accident or written off by insurance and has just been derego'ed because the rego lapsed then
the proicess for you is so much simpler!

All you need to do is book a time for the car to be inspected by a Entry Certifier, now don't be scared by these words. I was a bit confused when I came across this
title because the car isn't entering the country. But essentially a Entry Certifier does both reregistertation inspections and inspects cars coming into NZ for the first time. 

Finding an Entry Certifier is simple

NZTA have links to VTNZ, AA, VINZ ect - Not every branch do Entry Certs (https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/warrants-and-certificates/entry-certification/)

On a personal note: I used a entry certifier at a place called Fasttrack Automotive Compliance because they were easier to talk to and closer for me to 
get too. Because remember you cannot legally drive the car to these places. If you want to be in the certifiers good books and not get any nasty 
looks - Best turn up with the car on a tow truck or trailer.

But you can easily do your own research on where might be closer to you. Google "Car Compliance NZ" results will vary.

The cost may vary across different Certifiers but I was charged $399.98 inc GST at VINZ Mount Wellington, Auckland for a Entry Cert on a small 2-door coupe BMW.

If you go ahead, it will take the Entry Certifier a few days (If they aren't already busy) to complete the inspection. The inspection is similar to your typical
Warrant of Fitness check but a bit more involved. The Cerifier will take things apart such as the bumpers and splash guards to inspect the chassis and frame.

Once the Certifier completes the inspection (This is when it gets a bit nerve wracking) they'll give you a report and either tell you your car passed successfully!
Or that you need to sort a few things out before they can pass it. 
In my case I had one issue to sort, my headlight hasn't mounted properly and was a bit wobbley. I sourced a small headlight bracket and fixed the issue. 
The report also noted that my front brake rotors were almost near minimum wear and should be replaced soon BUT it wasn't illegal so it passed and you
can drive away with your new rego.

I towed my car down to the VINZ warehouse and got it inspected. When I knew it failed it was easy enough for me to replace the headlight 
bracket at VINZ in the parking lot.
They don't mind if you leave the car with them. (They lock up the cars at night) if you have an extreme issue like suspension 
components then this makes it harder to do in a parking lot and you'll need to pay again to get it towed for repair.

If you need to get something repaired, you'll have to make sure you get it resolved within 21 WORKING DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!
