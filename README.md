# Re-register Vehicle in New Zealand

My experience with re-registering a damaged car in New Zealand.

I'm writing this document out to help others that might be on the fence about getting a damaged car back on the road if you so disire, I'm also writing my 
expereince and what I went through to successfully get my BMW 135i E82 back on the kiwi roads.

There is a little to nothing on AA, VTNZ and VINZ websites on how to actaully achieve this and they all point you back to NZTA.

The NZTA site is your best bet and a basic Google of "How to reregister a car nz" will result in the web page that has steps on how to go through the process, but
found that the info wasn't accurate and wasn't as simple as I thought.



# Re-register car that HASN'T been damaged or written off by insurance or law enforcement.

If you have a car that is deregistered but hasn't been involved in an accident or written off by insurance and has just been derego'ed because the rego lapsed then
the process for you is so much simpler!

All you need to do is book a time for the car to be inspected by a Entry Certifier, now don't be scared by these words. I was a bit confused when I came across this
title because the car isn't entering the country. But essentially a Entry Certifier does both reregistertation inspections and inspects cars coming into NZ for the first time. 

Finding an Entry Certifier is simple

NZTA have links to VTNZ, AA, VINZ ect - Not every branch do Entry Certs (https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/warrants-and-certificates/entry-certification/)

Note: Remember you cannot legally drive the car to these places. If you want to be in the certifiers good books and not get any nasty 
looks don't drive the car there - Best turn up with the car on a tow truck or trailer.

The cost may vary across different Entry Certifiers, I was charged $399.98 inc GST at VINZ Mount Wellington, Auckland for a Entry Cert on a small 2-door coupe BMW.

If you go ahead, it will take the Entry Certifier a few days (If they aren't already busy) to complete the inspection. The inspection is similar to your typical
Warrant of Fitness check but a bit more involved. The Cerifier will take things apart such as the bumpers and splash guards to inspect the chassis and frame.

Once the Certifier completes the inspection (This is when it gets a bit nerve wracking) they'll give you a report and either tell you your car passed successfully!
Or that you need to sort a few things out before they can pass it. 
In my case I had one issue to sort, my headlight hasn't mounted properly and was a bit wobbley. I sourced a small headlight bracket and fixed the issue. 
The report also noted that my front brake rotors were almost near minimum wear and should be replaced soon BUT it wasn't illegal so it passed and you
can drive away with your new rego.

I towed my car down to the VINZ warehouse and got it inspected. When I knew it failed it was easy enough for me to replace the headlight 
bracket at VINZ in the parking lot.
They don't mind if you leave the car with them. (They lock up the cars at night) if you have an extreme issue like suspension 
components then this makes it harder to do in a parking lot and you'll need to pay again to get it towed for repair.

If you need to get something repaired, you'll have to make sure you get it resolved within 21 WORKING days, yes that's right working days.
So it gives you a couple of weekends too, otherwise you'll be another $400 out of pocket and have to get another inspection done entirely.

If you're not keen on taking that risk, you might have to do a bit of a search for someone to do a "Pre-Purchase Inspection" on a deregistered car.
Don't use your typical VTNZ for this job as they'll almost always miss something that a Entry Certifier will catch. Read reviews, blogs ect... 




# Re-register car that HAS been damaged or written off by insurance or law enforcement.

ALLLRIGHT! So this is the part where a lot of people such as car enthusiasts or people who simply like rebuilding cars will hopefully 
find what I provide here, helpful.

--- Breif Intro ---

So I purchased this BMW E82 135i with the N54 engine in November 2019. A car like this in New Zealand values around  $16k - $20k depending on milage, features ect... 
I got this E82 for $5k including one key and towing, which I think is an awesome price!
I found this BMW on Facebook marketplace (of all places...) and went and checked out the car. It had been in a minor accident 
but for some reason it was enough for insurance to write it off. As a car enthusiast and BMW repairer, it was odd that it was given the boot from the road. But meh 
what can you do...

I had the intention to track the car and never register it but of course COVID-19 came to the world and told myself I should register it so I could at least enjoy
it, now that the race tracks have limits on how many people can be on the track and be on-site. COVID sucks!!!!

Back to the car...
Car was completely drivable and functional. Started first go and had the typical dash lights showing. I only had the engine on for about 10 secs.
Front end was damaged, grills, radiators, front bumper, radiator support, left headlight and a slight dent on the bonnet.

I had fixed the E82 up completely. Brand new radiators, radiator support, front bumper bar blah blah blah... All OEM spec I had the car completely 
stripped at one point and managed to remove the engine from the car and do maintenance like replace gaskets, oil
downpipe upgrades, check turbos, clean frame and engine. Small things like this can make registering the car easier as the Certifier will 
see all the new parts easily and no leaks ect... Obviously this is completely unnecessary but it could give you browney points.

Skip ahead to September 2020 
The E82 is 100% looking great! Had taken it for small drives just up and down my driveway (and even a little bit up the road... Don't do this haha)
Just so I could get it's oil pumping and coolant rushing. 
I was very confident that the car was ready for an inspection.
I learnt quickly that the process between a lapsed car and a written off car is different.

---Process---

Stage 1: 
Get your paperwork together!

1. You will 100% need some sort of proof that the car belongs to you. The insurance papers, invoice ect. You will not get far without this.

2. All or some of the receipts/invoices of parts you purchased - You don't need all of them but just a few to prove the work has been done.



Stage 2:
Get the car to a repair certifier

I haven't mentioed this part yet, because this is probably the most complicated part.
If you have a damaged/written off car you will need to do this process regardless.
NZTA say you need to go to a Entry Certifier first while this is true for lapsed cars for damaged cars this isn't the case, unless you want to throw $400 away!

NZTA have a PDF of the only Repair Certifiers but this is touch and go and found it was out-dated,
some of the people on the list don't even have an activate phone number anymore. NZTA may update it but at current it's out-dated.
Use this website instead and find your closest repair certifier https://www.rca.co.nz/repair-certification-guide/

I contacted a repair certifier called John Hindmarch and he's a very nice bloke, very black and white, quick and onto it. But you can contact anyone of them.
They'll ask you when to bring the car, ask you what happened to the car, has it been fixed and do you have proof!

NOW - here's the complicated part! 
The Repair Cerifier needs to inspect the car, you obviuosly need a lift/hoist so they can check it out.
Now in my situation, John is mobile he goes around to places to inspect cars. I didn't have a hoist and he didn't either, so I then had to ring a Panel 
Beater (recommended by John) that knew what to do and was willing to help with removing the parts and provide a hoist. 
The Panel Beaters will then contact your repair certifier directly and you leave it to them to inspect.

If you happen to contact a Repair Certifier that has a workshop, this makes life SOOOO much easier for you and your wallet.

Cost:
Repair Certifier Inspection Cost: $299
Panel Beaters Cost: $129

1. Book the car with a repair certifier over the phone - Never by email (I learnt that these people aren't very active on the 
computer and they tend to forget about email bookings.)

2. You'll need to get the car towed or throw it on a tralier and drop it off to your choosen PanelBeaters

3. Your Repair Certifier will then go to the car or inspect at workshop.

4. Give them a full day to complete this as they check the car, head to toe and in extreme detail.

5. Once they complete the inspection, they'll contact you and give you the next steps

  5.A The Car passes - Needs no repairs or attention, they give you a Repair Certificate and report and you continue onto Stage 3 (The most stressful part done!)
  
  5.B The Car fails - They'll give you a report of what needs to be done and tell you what needs to be done and you choose to either continue with a repair or 
      take the car home. Unfortunately the repair CANNOT be completed by you anymore and must be reapired by a qualified panel beater or mechanic.
      This news can be very heartbreaking but you know it's possible to repair.
 
  5.C Hopefully you don't get this step, The Repair Certifier contacts you reporting that the car failed and cannot be repaired and has sustained 
      damage beyond repair and won't see the roads again. At this point I would recommend, and probably the repair certifier would as well, would be to
      either sell it for parts or wreck it...
      
      
      
Stage 3:
Get the car to a Entry Certifier

Now we are at the stage where the process is the same as a rego-lapsed car.
Tow or tralier your car to your preferred Entry Certifier branch, Remeber you cannot drive the car on the roads yet! 
Otherwise you'll face fines of almost $475 and 55 demerit points. Don't take that RISK!

Bring all your paperwork, some form of ID (Drivers License/Passport) and the repair certification.

1. Book a date with your Entry Cerifier to bring the car in. They'll check it over a couple of days. Leave paperwork in the car for them to check.

2. Once the entry certifier completes inspection they'll contact you.

   2.A. Entry Certifier passes the car - Go to Stage 4
   
   2.B. Entry Certifier fails the car, this can be for a few reasons like Brake Pads worn, wiper blades, tyres etc... Remember the Repair Certifier only checked
        the structure and build of the car. They didn't do a WOF check on the car - Resolve the issues asap
       
       
       
Stage 4: Registeration, Plates and License

You have almost reached the end of the process!!!! WOO HOO!!! 
This part is the most satisfying 

1. The Entry Certifier will bring the car around to you and pass it.

2. The Entry Certifier will then charge you for the following
   Cost of inspection: $399.99 inc GST
   Cost of licensing, registration and new plates: $227.54 for 6 months rego (For gasoline powered cars) 
   
3. They'll issue you a registeration label to place on your windscreen and two brand new random govt plates.

4. They'll update the NZTA system with your car details, plate and registeration. This happens quickly and results 
  can be seen instantly on https://www.carjam.co.nz

5. DRIVE AWAY AND SMILE!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can now legally drive the roads of New Zealand. p.s Get insurance before driving away! Only takes 5 mins 


# Time and Money Summary
So here's the *gulp* part and it wasn't as bad as I thought

BMW E82 $5000

Parts Total $1,281.67

Repair Certification Totals $559.00
Entry Certification $399.98
License and Registration $227.54

TOTAL $7,242.65
Not too bad for a car with a market value of $15k - $20k

# Summary
I really hope this helps others with their journey. I can foresee this being helpful for a lot of petrol heads and enthusiasts as I can't really imagine
your average person going through this procedure.
After speaking to others that have been through the same experience - It's well worth it! Especially if you have a car you really like, enjoy or is quite rare.

There will definitely be hard times and times where you want to give up, but don't! That first *legal* drive is the best!
